## Sorters
A sorting algorithm visualizer for the browser written mostly in Rust with
WebAssembly. To my knowledge, this is one of the most feature-packed sorting
algorithm visualizers available in the browser. It supports a variety of sorting
algorithms, visualizations, colorschemes and more.

## Removing Confusion from Petri Nets (Bachelor's Thesis)
Accompanying my bachelor's thesis, I wrote a Python implementation of the
algorithm described in the thesis. More information can be found on the Gitlab
repository and the thesis.
