            <h2>Flatpak</h2>
            <p>
                Flatpak is the best and easiest way to install a lot of apps. I
                recommend distro's that support Flatpak out of the box (e.g.
                Pop!_OS). A lot of commercial software, such as Spotify, is not
                available through <code>apt</code>, but is available through
                Flatpak. Install Flatseal to manage the permissions of Flatpak
                apps. Sidenote: Snap is not bad, but Flatpak is much better.

            <h2>Proton</h2>
            <p>
                You can install Steam on Linux too. Look up how to use Proton to
                run a lot of games that don't support Linux natively. Want to know
                whether a game will work well via Proton? Look the game up on
                ProtonDB.

            <h2>Alternatives to Windows Software</h2>
            <p>
                A lot of commercial software, such as Microsoft Office and Adobe
                Creative Cloud, is sadly not available on Linux. Luckily there
                are plenty of alternatives. A few are listed here. One thing to
                note is that these are not always drop-in replacements, many
                work slightly differently and take some getting used to.
                However, they don't lack much in functionality once yoiu get
                used to them.

            <h2>Command Line</h2>
            <p>
                There's no way around it: if you're using Linux, you have to use
                the command line sometimes. In most distributions, the standard
                shell is Bash, which is pretty good. Look up some tutorials to
                familiarize yourself with the most common commands:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>ls</code>: list files in directory</li>
                <li><code>mkdir</code>: make a new directory</li>
                <li><code>cd</code>: change directory</li>
                <li><code>mv</code>: move files</li>
                <li><code>cp</code>: copy files</li>
                <li><code>rm</code>: remove files</li>
                <li><code>cat</code>: show contents of a file and join input from multiple files</li>
                <li><code>less</code>: show content of a file with a nicer interface than <code>cat</code></li>
                <li><code>pwd</code>: show present working directory</li>
                <li><code>apt</code>: install, update and remove software (on Debian derivatives, such as Ubuntu)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/basics-of-bash-for-beginners-92e53a4c117a">Bash Guide for Beginners</a></p>
            <p>There are some optional programs which can be really helpful, or just fun:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>bat</code>: a better <code>cat</code>/<code>less</code></li>
                <li><code>ripgrep</code>: search files really fucking fast</li>
                <li><code>exa</code>: a better <code>ls</code></li>
                <li><code>nnn</code>: a super fast command line file manager</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are fed up with Bash, try other shells! Here are a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zsh (basically Bash with extra features)</li>
                <li>Fish (very user friendly)</li>
                <li>Nushell (more experimental, but really cool)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Password Manager</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone should be using a password manager, no matter what
                operating system you're on. When I chose my password manager I
                chose it based on the following criteria:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>must be well-established</li>
                <li>must be open source</li>
                <li>must have clients on a major platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac
                OSX, Android, iOS, Firefox & Chrome)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The first two criteria are for security reasons, I want to be able
                to check whether it is secure, or, if I don't check myself, I want
                other's to have check it's security. The last criterium is just
                convenience, as I want it to work on all platforms I use currently
                and I might use in the future. All this brought me to Bitwarden,
                essentially the best (open source) password manager around. And
                it has a free hosted plan too (in contrast with KeePass)!
            </p>
            <p>
                I installed the Bitwarden Linux, Firefox and Android clients and
                was ready to go.
